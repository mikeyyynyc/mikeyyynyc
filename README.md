â˜… I am 17 years old and currently attending the Urban Assembly Gateway School for Technology as a senior. My passion for becoming a software engineer is driven by a deep fascination with technology and video games. Ever since the 4th grade, I've been interested by how code can transform creative ideas into reality. The prospect of constantly keeping up with technology and continuously learning excites me, as I am eager to contribute to the entertainment of many others one day.. through the creation of video games that can hopefully be an escape for people. â˜… 

â˜… While your at it, take a look at my portofolio below where you can find some of the projects I've worked on! â˜…
